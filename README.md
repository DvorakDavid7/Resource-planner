# Notes for My Paper

Don’t forget to include \(E = mc^2\) examples of topicalization. They
look like this:

<span> </span>

## How to handle topicalization

I’ll just assume a tree structure like ().

<span> </span>

## Mood

Mood changes when there is a topic, as well as when there is
WH-movement. *Irrealis* is the mood when there is a non-subject topic or
WH-phrase in Comp. *Realis* is the mood when there is a subject topic or
WH-phrase.
